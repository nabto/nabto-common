# Streaming module.

The streaming module can create a reliable stream over an unrealiable
connection.


## Protocol documentation

The protocol documentation is found in a private repository
`protocol/streaming.md`

## Tests

The code has both unit tests and explorative tests in a seperate
private repository. Currently it is best to develop the code through
that repository such that the tests can be run as an integrated part
of the development cycle.
